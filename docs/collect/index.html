# dataset shareout

[Disney Ride Incident Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronjones32/universalwdw-incident-data-20022022)

raw: [csv](https://studentweb.cs.wwu.edu/~jensen33/data/incidents.csv) | [sqlite](https://studentweb.cs.wwu.edu/~jensen33/data/disney.db)

===

# introductions

theory: cohesive communities are built on names.

==

# go around (in order)

- name / (pronouns)?
- why are you here instead of somewhere else?

===

# stretch break (5 min).

===

# collect!

===

# background

==

# data set types

- observational
- experimental
- simulation
- derived

==

# observational

passive, watching.

==

# experimental

active, survey.

==

# simulation

'imagine taking a class with a mono tone professor...'

==

# derived

existing dataset, sifting through.

===

# ethical concerns

==

# checklist

- obtain consent
    - be clear and truthful about what and how data is collected and used.
- anonymize data
    - more data == less anonymous
    - impossible to guarantee [see link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3.pdf)
- analyze and address bias
    - ongoing research
    -
