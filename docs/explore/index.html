What is exploratory data analysis (EDA)?

==
**The process of finding out what is in your dataset:**
- Summary statistics
- Finding patterns, trends, relationships
- Creating visualizations to view and understand our data in a new way

==

### A four-step recipe to exploratory data analysis:
1. Get your data
2. Open and explore
3. Visualize your data
4. Ask questions (and try to answer them)
